        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            First I started learning with Nicos weg A1, and I go over 1~2 lessons each day. I improved FLIZ along the
            way to suit my study,
            and I got 96% in A1 after ~40 days of studying. And then after resting for 2 weeks I kept on with Nicos weg
            A2. Somehow, I have found
            out that there was not much to learn in the A2 material: after like 20 lessons in I did 3~4 mock tests of A2
            including goethe's offical
            mock test and got like a 90% average. So i have decided just look at the grammar points like past tenses and
            just to go through B1 straight away. I have gone over B1's materials in a month and a half and after 2 weeks
            of revising I have got 82% in my B1 exam.
            I made this extension to learn latin initially but to pass German test I have also added a lot of useful
            features. Every feature I put in this extension is because I as a language learner need it.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mb-4">How did i learn Nicos weg with FLIZ</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            First I walk through the vocab sections of nicos weg, use the search feature to add unlearned words in my
            vocab deck. And then I go through them using the learning features. J
            <img src="latintroduce/german1.png">
            And then i go over then in my extension, it is like a duolinguo(?) style of learning so to learn repeatedly
            through quizzes. As you can see i have gone over 1296 words, the orange bar means the amount of words I have
            gone over twice.

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            The extension will detects words you just added automatically
            so its really easy to learn.After learning then I try to write down the conversation in nicos weg's video
            without looking at the
            subtitle and i listen to it multiple times to transcribe. With knowing a lot of words already it helped me
            to be more confident in learning. (Pink is what i wrote down, blue is corrction)
            <img src="latintroduce/german3.png">
            After having done 2 lessons with Nicos weg if I feel like it I will do some transcribing test with FLIZ. It
            randomly select words and speak and you can try to write them down.
